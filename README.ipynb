    "- Imagine you are in a car equipped with sensors on the outside. The car sensors can detect objects moving around: for example, the sensors might detect a pedestrian, or even a bicycle. \n",
    "- The Unscented Kalman filter demonstrated in this repo uses the CTRV motion model\n",
    "- For variety, let's step through the Unscented Kalman Filter algorithm using the bicycle example.\n",
    "- The Kalman Filter algorithm will go through the following steps:   \n",
    "     **1] First Measurement** : the filter will receive initial measurements of the bicycle's position relative to the car. These measurements will come from a radar or lidar sensor.    \n",
    "     **2] Initialize State and Covariance matrices** : the filter will initialize the bicycle's position based on the first measurement. Then the car will receive another sensor measurement after a time period Δt.   \n",
    "     **3] Predict** : the algorithm will predict where the bicycle will be after time Δt.         \n",
    "     **4] Update** : the filter compares the \"predicted\" location with what the sensor measurement says.\n",
